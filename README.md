&nbsp;

This is a electron based desktop app that turns gogoanime into a desktop app 
without all those silly ads and trackers because who needs those right? :wink:

&nbsp;

**Features** :rocket:
&nbsp;

- Ad Blocking
- Discord RPC support
- Persistance (so you can pickup where you left off)
  
&nbsp;

**FAQ** :question:
&nbsp;

- I See a white screen what do I do? 
> this usally means that the host site is down 
> you may have to try again later :(
&nbsp;
- I Found a Ad what do I do?
> While this project aims to be adless it isnt perfect 
> If you find a ad the best thing you can do is note down the ad
> and report it it seems to sometimes bypass the filter by being in 
> in the video embed though its a rare situation :(



**Current known issues include:**

- A slight delay when updating DiscordRPC
- DiscordRPC stuck on watching while searching for anime
- Scroll bar is not hidden (when hidden stops scrolling ;-;)



---

**TODOS:**

- hide scrollbar without ruining app
